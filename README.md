# Hearts

This project is a coding assignment for a graduate AI class. The students are responsible for programming an agent to play the card game Hearts. They must fill out all of the methods in `template_player.py`, but may add any other methods necessary for their agent to play. Then each student's agent may be played tournament style against other agents in the class.
